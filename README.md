# CIC_IDS_Hybrid_Model
A hybrid deep learning and machine learning–based intrusion detection system using LSTM/GRU for sequential feature learning, stacked autoencoders for feature compression, and SVM for final classification, evaluated on the CIC-IDS-2017 benchmark dataset.

# Hybrid Intrusion Detection System using LSTM, GRU, SAE, and SVM

This repository presents an end-to-end **hybrid intrusion detection system (IDS)** developed using the **CIC-IDS-2017** benchmark dataset.  
The proposed framework combines **deep sequential learning**, **unsupervised feature compression**, and **classical machine learning** to achieve robust and high-accuracy network attack detection.


Due to size and licensing constraints, the CIC-IDS-2017 dataset is not included.
